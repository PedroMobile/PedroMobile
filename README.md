# üöÄ Expertise

Passionate about crafting interactive and intuitive mobile experiences, I specialize in mobile software engineering, utilizing both native and hybrid technologies. With almost 7 years of experience dedicated to honing my skills in mobile development, I've led teams, designed system guidelines, and upheld the highest standards in app performance and user experience.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to serve as a Senior Software Engineer, where my technical expertise met the challenges of team leadership. Beyond creating cutting-edge mobile applications, I embraced the responsibilities of guiding my team with strategic oversight, ensuring efficient project execution and top-notch results.

In addition to my professional endeavors, I've embraced the role of a "content creator" in the tech sphere, offering a unique perspective on mobile technologies with a touch of humor.

Outside of work, I have a passion for creating "art" using exclusively CSS, a practice that sharpens my technical skills while allowing me to blend creativity and programming in an engaging and innovative way.
